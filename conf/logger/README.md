# Changing Logger Settings

You can change logger settings by adding files in this sub-directory.

The files have to be named:

    ??-logger.conf

    # or

    ??-prinbeed.conf

Where `??` represents a number from 00 to 99. In general, the administrator
should use `50-prinbeed.conf`. Other projects may use other numbers.
