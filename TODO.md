# bigint

I may want to create a separate project for that one too, at some point,
although right now I have no need outside of the database.

However, the multiplication and division are both very slow and would need
to be fixed (i.e. use the more complex but much faster algorithms available).

Another library we should probably use is GMP:

# snaplogger / communicator / fluid-settings

These need to be installed properly using the corresponding variables
(see the iplock project for example on how to do this).
